### `Talk2Book.ipynb`

</a>

Use this to talk to '1984'. Embeddings for this book have already been created so you can use it out of the box ðŸ“¦

### `Book2Vec.ipynb`

</a>

Use this to see how embeddings for '1984' were made or create your own for another book!

## Limitations
This can't yet do summaries or continue a conversaion; each question gets a single answer. Contributions for these are very welcome!

## Potential improvements
Save good outputs to use as examples in the prompt (few shot).

## How can I talk to another book?
1. Create a vector store with embeddings using `Book2Vec.ipynb`
2. Upload to https://huggingface.co as a dataset (recommended)
3. Use `Talk2Book.ipynb` with the vector store you created

And make it an app:

4. Duplicate this [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/calmgoose/Talk2Book) (or just copy the code in `app.py`) and change the vector store to the one you created in step 2

## Contributing
1. Fork
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (also at the top of each notebook)
3. Install [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html): `pip instal nbdev`
4. Make changes, run your notebooks

In the terminal, before each commit:

5. Run [`nbdev_install_hooks`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#install-hooks-for-git-friendly-notebooks) to clean the notebooks (removes metadata)

And finally:

6. Submit your PR


**Using Codespaces/VSCode**

Everything you need will be installed when you open Codespaces/VSCode; specified in `.devcontainer/`

*Notes for Codespaces:*

- Currently Jupyter notebook doesnâ€™t work on Codespaces for an unknown reason, or at least I canâ€™t, so youâ€™ll have to use JupyterLab
- Open with `jupyter lab --NotebookApp.allow_origin='*' --NotebookApp.ip='0.0.0.0'`
- For more info on using see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/notebooks-web
